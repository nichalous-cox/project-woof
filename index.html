						Dog Activity level
					</h2>
					<p>They are a high-energy working dog. They are not couch potatos. They want to be active and busy most of the time.

				<h4> Care for this Pupper
				</h4>
					<p>
					The hardworking Australian Cattle dog is best suited to an environment where they get plenty of physical and mental stimulation. They are not well suited to living in an apartment or being left alone for long periods of time. They become destructive when bored, and tend to chew â€” a lot. They need a home with a securely fenced yard, or a country farm or ranch.</p>
